# Photo-OCR
An application that detects hand-written numbers using machine learning. Developed from scratch.

Historically, the [MNIST dataset](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/open-datasets/catalog/mnist/) is used as benchmark training and testing for several machine learning algorithms. This repository uses a simple neural network to classify the digits in these images with **97.5%** accuracy.
